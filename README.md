# Project Name - Final Integrated Project  


## Description-
I've been given the final assignment for this term, and it involves sprucing up the design and layout of three web pages on an existing site using HTML and CSS. This project has given me hands-on experience with different software, giving me some useful insights into the tools needed for web development. It's been a journey of learningâ€”planning, doing, and nailing down specific tasks.



## Technology used - 
For my Final Integrated Projects (FIPs), I've been diving into different software tools like Adobe XD, Photoshop, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and a bunch of media creation apps. To keep things organized and on track, I rely on Google Calendar and Notion for project management. Oh, and I've set up specific timelines for each FIP to make sure I'm making smooth and steady progress.
